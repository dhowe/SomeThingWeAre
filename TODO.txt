TASK-LIST:

Daniel:

	** Timing: Recheck - **make all time stamps/image-change-triggers (per loop) 
		so that they are calculated relative to start *only* of the audio**

	** Remove (if still necessary) subtitling from "TITLE" and "CREDITS"
	** Implement image flipping instead of noimage.jpg
	** Test selected-image in SearchResult
	
	fix UI button functionality [done]
	implement UI slider tracking/messaging [done] 
	Provide John with credits/thanks information ! [done,above]
	Fix Johns Cropping request #22 below [done]
	Work out caching mechanism for images on ipad [done]
  Check we are collecting embedded urls in SearchResult class [done]
	Fix bug (see below) -- [Waiting on John's reply]
	Check drop-down generation in interface [done]
	Reply Sally about her design [done]
	Write json search results to be sent to interface [done]
	Change Google image [done]
	Fix SomeGenerator bug (2nd below - we've seen it before, tries 4ever) [done]
	Decide on and implement extra runtime memory (my sys: crash on 2nd loop) [done]
	 disable tinting for the title and credits card/shots (also for any movies I think) [done]
	
	Test Test Test
	
John:
	[done] List of Colors
	[done] remove punctuation from phrases
	[done] Contact ISEA guy about audio
	[done] Finish phrase-counts file
	[done] decide on keywords
	[done] Find set of images (>	10) for the phrase â€œthere had been books"
	Create Title and Credits images (or delegate to Sally)
	  - "generative movies based on an original short story by DCH"
	[done] Select list of Colors (>=6) and [done] Keywords (~10)  [enter in SomeSuper.java]
	Find/select some short movies that can be looped (>= length)
	
Optional:
	** Multiple images per frames number in frames_key dir (let the program pick randomly)
		this way if a user picks the same keywords twice, they don't get the same movie
	

BUGS:

	Timing: Audio/Frame Sync ?

	#22: when you arrange to do a crop, and you have to crop vertically (top and bottom) 
	I think it might be better to move the image down a little rather than centering it
	vertically before doing the crop in order to get more of the upper part of the original 
	non-16:9 image (centering for a horizontal crop is fine)  [done]
