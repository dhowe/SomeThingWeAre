Read for us … and show us the pictures
Mixed media installation, custom software, 2015

Founded on its earlier installation, Read For Us, _The Readers Project_ presents the work of a software entity that generates digital video montage, with visual content sourced through live image search. The Montage Reader — developed initially for English — analyses its text and first establishes a overall visual grammar based on closed-class words that underlie linguistic structure. The reader then searches for images corresponding to phrases — 'longest common phrases' whenever possible — finally composing a sequence of images that corresponds with the written language of the text both structurally and also semantically — at least in so far as contemporary image search proposes a correspondence that is meaningful for the human user-readers of network services and their aggregation of crowd-sourced indexing. Texts read by the Montage Reader may include parts of Adam Smith's _An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations_ (1776), and 'Some Thing We Are,' a short story by Daniel C. Howe.
