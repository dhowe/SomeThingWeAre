The annual labour of every nation
is the fund which
originally supplies it with all the
necessaries and conveniencies of life which
it annually consumes
and which consist
always either in the
immediate produce of
that labour or in
what is purchased with
that produce froms
other nations according therefore as this
produce or what is
purchased with it
bears a greater or smaller proportion
to the number of those who
are to consume it the
nation will be better
or worse supplied with
all the necessaries and conveniencies.
