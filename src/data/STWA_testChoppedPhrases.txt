Some Thing We Are
The room remained dark.
There was little
that would benefit
from illumination.
A stone window
without glass.
A square bed
on casters.
A cistern
of leaves.
There had been books,
but now there were none.
She squinted
toward the wall,
holding his tin of matches
in the thick air.
She lit one
and watched
the flare of the sulphur,
then the dying.
He seemed to be
holding something out to her.
She tried to remember
his features
from before when there had been light.
She tried
to remember
her own.
It was no use.
There was the dry sound
of dead crickets rustling
in the wind.
‘Hey, take it,’
His voice was unexpected
in the milky, thickening dark.
It sounded young
and thin.
It made her want
to remember his mouth.
She tried to remember
the wetness.
It was too much.
Her head hurt
and she felt sick.
She reached out
for what he was holding,
but he had put it down.
