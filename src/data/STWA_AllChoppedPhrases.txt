Some Thing We Are
the room remained dark
there was little
that would benefit
from illumination
a stone window
without glass
a square bed
on casters
a cistern
of leaves
there had been books
but now there were none
she squinted
toward the wall
holding his tin of matches
in the thick air
she lit one
and watched
the flare of the sulphur
then the dying
he seemed to be
holding something out to her
she tried to remember
his features
from before when there had been light
she tried
to remember
her own
it was no use
there was the dry sound
of dead crickets rustling
in the wind
‘Hey. Take it’
his voice was unexpected
in the milky, thickening dark
it sounded young
and thin
it made her want
to remember his mouth
she tried to remember
the wetness
it was too much
her head hurt
and she felt sick
she reached out
for what he was holding
but he had put it down
‘Don’t you want it?’
he said, sounding surprised
she leaned back
against the bed
and said nothing
she thought
of the empty river flowing
below the window
extending five meters upstream
and down
before fading out
she thought
of the stone tree
that hung its boughs
over the edge
‘You were the one
who wanted
to stop for it’
he said
‘Now you don’t want it?
Is that it?’
she pressed
her thumbnails
to the skin of her temples
‘No’ she heard herself say
‘I don’t think
that’s right’
she heard him sigh
she listened
for the silent highway four kilometers
to the west
‘That’s not right’
she said again
‘What’s not right?’
he said slowly
‘I distinctly remember
going past the place
and you saying that we should stop
that we should get it’
his voice rose slowly in pitch
as he spoke
as if proceeding
with a child
‘No’ she said
‘I only asked
if you wanted to stop
and get it
You wanted to
not me’
she let her head fall
to her forearms
‘Why’ he said
‘do you always have
to do this?
I don’t understand it
Everything was going so well’
‘I’m not doing anything’
she said
‘I’m just saying what happened
I asked
and you said what you wanted
Then we stopped’
she noticed the moon
through the window
a purple finger
‘Fine’ he said
‘It doesn’t matter anymore
We have it now’
he shook his head at her
through the haze
‘Do you think you want it’
he asked
‘Do you think you
want it now?’
‘Yes’ she said finally
she felt sure
that she did want it
though she could not remember why
she reached
toward his fingers
‘It will make you feel better’
he said
‘Yes’ she said
‘I think it will’
‘I’m glad
we decided to get it’
he said, holding it
out to her
‘I find it
so difficult
when you get like this’
she paused
then dropped her hand
‘You sound
very self-righteous
when you talk
like that’
she said
‘Do you know that?’
the light seemed different
to her now, brindled
and somehow sharper
at the edges
‘What?’ he said
‘What did you say?’
‘You heard me’
she said
‘As if it’s any different
for you
to want it for you
or to want it for me
for you’
‘What are you talking about?’
he asked in exasperation
she leaned back
against the bed
and pressed her fingers
to her forehead
‘You know
sometimes I don’t know
if I can trust you
that’s all’
she looked towards
where he’d been
‘That’s what I’m talking about’
he was slumped silently
against the wall
she felt sure
that the light was changing
now, growing harsher
and more acutely angled
she wanted an end
to conversations
‘Were we somewhere
before this godforsaken room?’
‘I don’t understand
why you have to be
like this?’
he said
after a moment, struggling
to keep his voice even
and slow
ignoring the question
‘I don’t understand it at all’
his measured words seemed finally
to pierce her control
there were panes of glass cracking
behind her eyes
for a moment
it seemed
as if she could not continue
there was no reason
then she knew
she would continue
when he started
to speak again
she cut him off
‘I’m sorry’
she said
‘I can’t help it
when I get like this’
there was an expanse
of silence
‘You know that’
she said
‘don’t you?’
‘I know it’
he said softly
after a moment
she looked now
for his outline, tried
to approximate the position
of his face
she felt suddenly
that there were things worth saving
‘I love you’
she said quietly
into the now geometric darkness
‘I know’
he answered
his voice sounding delicate
and young again
nearer to her
she anticipated the soothing proximity
of his body
the smell of his skin
and his sweat, faintly
like cumin
the delicate brush
of his fingers
instead, she heard his voice again
from near the wall
‘Do you want it
do you think
that you want it now?’
she did not reply
only after a moment
did she reach out her arm
and finally make contact
bringing it back
towards her
‘It will make you feel better’
he said
‘I’m sure it will’
‘Yes’ she whispered
tilting her head back
having it finally
knowing that it would not
in the least
make her feel better
